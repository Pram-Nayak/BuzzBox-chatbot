# BuzzBox Chatbot

BuzzBox is a simple AI chatbot built using Python, Tkinter (for GUI), and a neural network model trained on predefined intents. The chatbot responds to user queries based on a trained model and can be customized to handle different conversational intents.

## Features
- Interactive GUI built with Tkinter
- Pre-trained neural network model for text classification
- JSON-based intent recognition system
- Handles user messages and generates appropriate responses
- Supports basic small talk and store-related queries


## How It Works
1. **User Input**: The user enters a message in the GUI.
2. **Text Processing**: The input is tokenized and converted into a bag-of-words representation.
3. **Neural Network Model**: The model predicts the intent of the message based on training.
4. **Response Generation**: The bot selects an appropriate response from the predefined dataset.
5. **Display**: The chatbot's response is displayed in the chat window.
